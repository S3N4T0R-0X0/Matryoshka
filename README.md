This repository contains a C++ program that can be used to simulate malware that exploits the messaging platforms Telegram or Discord to achieve its programmed goals. In this case, the program exploits "Maga" to dump data by providing the malware with information that it can use to extract data through the platform.


The program is designed for ease of use and can be easily modified to include evasion techniques in the future.
